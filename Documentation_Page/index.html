          <p>
            NAT has many uses, but its primary use is to conserve public IPv4 addresses. It does this by allowing networks to ise private IPv4 internally and providing
            translation to a public address only when needed. 

          </p>

          <p>
            NAT- enabled rputers can be configured with one or more vald public IPv4 addresses, These public addresses are known as NAT pool.
            When an internal device sends traffic out of the network , the NAT enabled router translates the internal  IPv4 addresses of the device to a public address from the NAT pool.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
             A NAT router typically operates at the border of a stub network. A stub network is one or more networks with a single connection to its neighboring network, one way in and out of the network.

        <article>
          <p>in NAT terminology, the inside network is the set of networks that is subject to translation.
            The outside networks that refers to all other networks. <br>
            NAT includes four types of addresses:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Inside local address</strong> - The address of the source as seen from inside the network.
                This is typically a private IPv4 address.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Inside global addreess.</strong> - The address of the source as seen from the outdside network. This is typically a globally routable IPv4 address.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Outside global address</strong> - The address of the destination as seen from the outside netwrok. It is globally routable IPv4 address assigned to a host on the internet.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Outside local address</strong> - The address of the destination as seen from the inside ntewrok.
            </li>
            <p>
                When determining which type of address is used, it is impoertant to remember that NAT terminology is always applies from the 
                prespective of the device with the translated address.
            </p>
            <li>
                <strong>Local address</strong> - A local address is any address that appears on the inside poertion of the network.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Global address</strong>- A global address is any address that appears on the outside poertion of the network.

            <li>
                <strong>Static NAT</strong> <br>
                Static NAT uses a one-to-one mapping of local and global addresses. These mappings are configured by 
                the ntework admin and remain constant. Static NAT is particularly useful for web servers or devces that 
                must have a cosnsistent address that is accessible from the internet, such as company web server. It is also useful for devices
                that must be accessible by authorized personnel when offsite, buty not by the general public on the internet.
                For example, a network administrator from PC4 can use SSH to gain access to the inside global address of Svr1 (209.165.200.226). 
                R2 translates this inside global address to the inside local address 192.168.10.10 and connects the session to Svr1. <br>
                Static NAT requires that enough public addresses are available to satisfy the total number of simultaneous user sessions.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Dynamic NAT</strong> <br>
                Dynamic NAT uses a pool of public addresses and assigns them on a first-come, first-served basis. When an inside device requests
                access to an outside network, dynamic NAT assigns an available public IPv4 address from the pool.
            </li>
            <li> <strong>Port Address Translation</strong><br>
                Port Address Translation (PAT), also known as NAT overload, maps multiple private IPv4 addresses to a single public IPv4 address 
                or a few addresses. This is what most home routers do. The ISP assigns one address to the router, yet several members of the household 
                can simultaneously access the internet. This is the most common form of NAT for both the home and the enterprise. <br>

                <br> With PAT, multiple addresses can be mapped to one or to a few addresses, because each private address is also tracked by a port number. When a device 
                initiates a TCP/IP session, it generates a TCP or UDP source port value, or a specially assigned query ID for ICMP, to uniquely identify the session. 
                When the NAT router receives a packet from the client, it uses its source port number to uniquely identify the specific NAT translation. <br>

                <br>PAT ensures that devices use a different TCP port number for each session with a server on the internet. When a response comes back from the server, the source port 
                number, which becomes the destination port number on the return trip, determines to which device the router forwards the packets. The PAT process also validates that the 
                incoming packets were requested, thus adding a degree of security to the session.

      <section class="main-section" id="next_available_ports">
        <header>Next Available Port</header>
        <article>
            PAT attempts to preserve the original source port. However, if the original source port is already used, PAT assigns the first available port number starting from the 
            beginning of the appropriate port group 0-511, 512-1,023, or 1,024-65,535. When there are no more ports available and there is more than one external address in the address 
            pool, PAT moves to the next address to try to allocate the original source port. This process continues until there are no more available ports or external IPv4 addresses. <br>
             <img src="download (1).png" alt="">
            <br> The hosts have chosen the same port number of 1444. This is acceptable for the inside address, because the hosts have unique private IPv4 addresses. However, at the NAT router, 
            the port numbers must be changed; otherwise, packets from two different hosts would exit R2 with the same source address. This example assumes that the first 420 ports in the 
            range 1,024 - 65,535 are already in use, so the next available port number, 1445, is used.

            <br> When packets are returned from outside the network, if the source port number was previously modified by the NAT-enable router, the destination port number will now be changed back to the original port number by the NAT-enabled router.

        <article>
          <strong>Advantages Of NAT</strong>
          <p>
            NAT solves our problem of not having enough IPv4 
            addresses, but it can also create other problems. 
            This topic addresses the advantages and disadvantage of NAT.
          </p>
          <p>
            NAT provides many benefits, including the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>NAT conserves the legally registered addressing scheme by
                allowing the privatization of intranets. NAT conserves 
                addresses through application port-level multiplexing. With 
                NAT overload (PAT), internal hosts can share a single public
                 IPv4 address for all external communications. In this type of 
                 configuration, very few external addresses are required to support 
                 many internal hosts.</li>
            <li>NAT increases the flexibility of connections to the public network. 
                Multiple pools, backup pools, and load-balancing pools can be implemented 
                to ensure reliable public network connections.</li>
            <li>NAT provides consistency for internal network addressing schemes. On a 
                network not using private IPv4 addresses and NAT, changing the public 
                IPv4 address scheme requires the readdressing of all hosts on the existing 
                network. The costs of readdressing hosts can be significant. NAT allows the 
                existing private IPv4 address scheme to remain while allowing for easy change 
                to a new public addressing scheme. This means an organization could change ISPs 
                and not need to change any of its inside clients.</li>
            <li>NAT provides consistency for internal network addressing schemes. On a network
                not using private IPv4 addresses and NAT, changing the public IPv4 address scheme 
                requires the readdressing of all hosts on the existing network. The costs of readdressing 
                hosts can be significant. NAT allows the existing private IPv4 address scheme to remain 
                while allowing for easy change to a new public addressing scheme. This means an organization
                 could change ISPs and not need to change any of its inside clients.</li>
          </ul>
          <strong>Diadvantages of NAT</strong>
          <p>NAT does have drawbacks. The fact that hosts on the internet appear to communicate directly 
            with the NAT-enabled device, rather than with the actual host inside the private network, 
            creates a number of issues.</p>
          <p>One disadvantage of using NAT is related to network performance, particularly for real time
             protocols such as VoIP. NAT increases forwarding delays because the translation of each IPv4 
             address within the packet headers takes time. The first packet is always process-switched 
             going through the slower path. The router must look at every packet to decide whether it 
             needs translation. The router must alter the IPv4 header, and possibly alter the TCP or UDP 
             header. The IPv4 header checksum, along with the TCP or UDP checksum must be recalculated each 
             time a translation is made. Remaining packets go through the fast-switched path if a cache entry 
             exists; otherwise, they too are delayed.</p>
          <p>The forwarding delays caused by the NAT process becomes more of an issue as the pools of public 
            IPv4 addresses for ISPs become depleted. Many ISPs are having to assign customers a private IPv4 
            address instead of a public IPv4 address. This means the customer's router translates the packet 
            from its private IPv4 address to the private IPv4 address of the ISP. Before forwarding the packet 
            to another provider, the ISP will then perform NAT again, translating its private IPv4 addresses to 
            one of its limited number of public IPv4 addresses. This process of two layers of NAT translation is 
            known as Carrier Grade NAT (CGN).</p>

        <article>
          <p>
            In this topic, you will learn how to configure and verify static NAT. It includes a Packet Tracer 
            activity to test your skills and knowledge. Static NAT is a one-to-one mapping between an inside 
            address and an outside address. Static NAT allows external devices to initiate connections to internal 
            devices using the statically assigned public address. For instance, an internal web server may be 
            mapped to a specific inside global address so that it is accessible from outside networks.

            The figure shows an inside network containing a web server with a private IPv4 address. Router R2 is configured 
            with static NAT to allow devices on the outside network (internet) to access the web server. The client on the 
            outside network accesses the web server using a public IPv4 address. Static NAT translates the public IPv4 address 
            to the private IPv4 address.
          </p>
          <img src="" alt="">
          <p>
            There are two basic tasks when configuring static NAT translations:

            <br> <strong>Step 1</strong>. The first task is to create a mapping between the inside local address and the inside global addresses. 
            For example, the 192.168.10.254 inside local address and the 209.165.201.5 inside global address in the figure 
            are configured as a static NAT translation.
          </p>
          <code>R2(config)# ip nat inside source static 192.168.10.254 209.165.201.5</code>
          <p>
            <br> <strong>Step 2.</strong> After the mapping is configured, the interfaces participating in the translation are configured as inside or outside 
            relative to NAT. In the example, the R2 Serial 0/1/0 interface is an inside interface and Serial 0/1/1 is an outside interface
          </p>

          <code>
            R2(config)# interface serial 0/1/0
            R2(config-if)# ip address 192.168.1.2 255.255.255.252
            R2(config-if)# ip nat inside
            R2(config-if)# exit
            R2(config)# interface serial 0/1/1
            R2(config-if)# ip address 209.165.200.1 255.255.255.252
            R2(config-if)# ip nat outside</code>

            <p>With this configuration in place, packets arriving 
                on the inside interface of R2 (Serial 0/1/0) from 
                the configured inside local IPv4 address (192.168.10.254) 
                are translated and then forwarded towards the outside network. 
                Packets arriving on the outside interface of R2 (Serial 0/1/1),
                that are addressed to the configured inside global IPv4 address
                (209.165.201.5), are translated to the inside local address 
                (192.168.10.254) and then forwarded to the inside network.

        <header>Dynamic NAT Scenario</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            In this topic, you will learn how to configure and 
            verify dynamic NAT. It includes a Packet Tracer activity 
            to test your skills and knowledge. Although static NAT 
            provides a permanent mapping between an inside local address
             and an inside global address, dynamic NAT automatically 
             maps inside local addresses to inside global addresses. 
             These inside global addresses are typically public IPv4 
             addresses. Dynamic NAT, like static NAT, requires the configuration 
             of the inside and outside interfaces participating in NAT with the i
             p nat inside and ip nat outside interface configuration commands. 
             However, where static NAT creates a permanent mapping to a single 
             address, dynamic NAT uses a pool of addresses
          </p>

          <p>
            Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window
            or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or
            frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is
            declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an
            iframe as parent.phoneNumber.

            In this topic, you will learn how to configure 
            and verify PAT. It includes a Packet Tracer activity t
            o test your skills and knowledge. There are two ways 
            to configure PAT, depending on how the ISP allocates 
            public IPv4 addresses. In the first instance, the ISP 
            allocates a single public IPv4 address that is required 
            for the organization to connect to the ISP and in the 
            other, it allocates more than one public IPv4 address 
            to the organization.
          </p>
          <img src="Screenshot 2024-04-10 221553.png" alt="" width="800" height="400">

          <p>To configure PAT to use a single IPv4 address, simply add 
            the keyword overload to the ip nat inside source command. 
            The rest of the configuration is the similar to static and 
            dynamic NAT configuration except that with PAT, multiple hosts 
            can use the same public IPv4 address to access the internet.

            <br>In the example, all hosts from network 192.168.0.0/16 (matching ACL 1) 
            that send traffic through router R2 to the internet will be translated t
            o IPv4 address 209.165.200.225 (IPv4 address of interface S0/1/1). The 
            traffic flows will be identified by port numbers in the NAT table because

        <header>NAT for IPv6?</header>
        <article>
          <p>Because many networks use both IPv4 and IPv6, there needs to be a 
            way to use IPv6 with NAT. This topic discusses how IPv6 can be integrated 
            with NAT. IPv6, with a 128-bit address, provides 340 undecillion addresses. 
            Therefore, address space is not an issue. IPv6 was developed with the 
            intention of making NAT for IPv4 with translation between public and 
            private IPv4 addresses unnecessary. However, IPv6 does include its own 
            IPv6 private address space, unique local addresses (ULAs). <br>

            <br> IPv6 unique local addresses (ULA) are similar to RFC 1918 private 
            addresses in IPv4 but have a different purpose. ULA addresses are meant
            for only local communications within a site. ULA addresses are not meant 
            to provide additional IPv6 address space, nor to provide a level of security. <br>
            
            <br>IPv6 does provide for protocol translation between IPv4 and IPv6 known as NAT64.
        </p>
          <p>Ideally, IPv6 should be run natively wherever possible. This means IPv6 devices 
            communicating with each other over IPv6 networks. However, to aid in the move from 
            IPv4 to IPv6, the IETF has developed several transition techniques to accommodate a
             variety of IPv4-to-IPv6 scenarios, including dual-stack, tunneling, and translation. <br>

            <br>Dual-stack is when the devices are running protocols associated with both IPv4 and IPv6. 
            Tunneling for IPV6 is the process of encapsulating an IPv6 packet inside an IPv4 packet.  
            This allows the IPv6 packet to be transmitted over an IPv4-only network. <br>
            
            <br>NAT for IPv6 should not be used as a long-term strategy, but as a temporary mechanism to
            assist in the migration from IPv4 to IPv6. Over the years, there have been several types 
            of NAT for IPv6 including Network Address Translation-Protocol Translation (NAT-PT). NAT-PT
             has been deprecated by IETF in favor of its replacement, NAT64. NAT64 is beyond the scope 
             of this curriculum.</p>

            The output of the show ip nat translations command displays all static translations that have 
            been configured and any dynamic translations that have been created by traffic

        <header>Configure PAT to Use a Single IPv4 Address</header>
        <p>
            To configure PAT to use a single IPv4 address, simply add 
            the keyword overload to the ip nat inside source command. 
            The rest of the configuration is the similar to static and 
            dynamic NAT configuration except that with PAT, multiple hosts 
            can use the same public IPv4 address to access the internet. <br>

            In the example, all hosts from network 192.168.0.0/16 (matching ACL 1) that 
            send traffic through router R2 to the internet will be translated to IPv4 
            address 209.165.200.225 (IPv4 address of interface S0/1/1). The traffic flows
            will be identified by port numbers in the NAT table because the overload keyword 
            is configured.
        </p>
        <code>
            R2(config)# ip nat inside source list 1 interface serial 0/1/1 overload
            R2(config)# access-list 1 permit 192.168.0.0 0.0.255.255
            R2(config)# interface serial0/1/0
            R2(config-if)# ip nat inside
            R2(config-if)# exit
            R2(config)# interface Serial0/1/1
